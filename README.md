# Geometry Dash Unix Sync

A tiny mod for geometry dash that updates ItemIDs 7501-7513 to be set to current unix, date, and time values.<br />
This allows for levels to sync between players with the globed mod.<br />
The functionality of this mod can be enabled via level options.<br />
The unix timestamp in the corner of the screen can be removed via mod options.<br />

ItemIDs:<br />
7501 - 4 digit unix time<br />
7502 - 4th digit of unix time<br />
7503 - 3rd digit of unix time<br />
7504 - 2nd digit of unix time<br />
7505 - 1st digit of unix time<br />
7506 - 6 digits of unix time (longest geometry dash allows in an ItemID)<br />
7507 - pseudo random 2 digit number (will be the same for all users of the mod)<br />
7508 - current year<br />
7509 - current month<br />
7510 - current day<br />
7511 - current hour (UTC)<br />
7512 - current minute<br />
7513 - current second<br />
