# Unix Sync

A tiny mod for geometry dash that updates ItemIDs 7501-7507 to be set to current unix time values.
This allows for levels to sync between players with the globed mod.
The functionality of this mod can be enabled via level options.

ItemIDs:
7501 - 4 digit unix time
7502 - 4th digit of unix time
7503 - 3rd digit of unix time
5704 - 2nd digit of unix time
5705 - 1st digit of unix time
5706 - 6 digits of unix time (longest geometry dash allows in an ItemID)
5707 - pseudo random 2 digit number based off of the unix time value
